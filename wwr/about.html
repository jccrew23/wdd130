                <p>Clear Valley Rafting was established in 1969 when Dr. John Mallow was looking for an adventurous new way to explore the beauties of the nature that resides around his vacation cabin. As a busy doctor, it was imperative that he have a place to debrief and relax, and luckily he found solace in the mountains. As a lover of the water, he wanted to be able to share the new views and adrenline he expereinced during his rafting experiences.Thus became Clear Valley White Water Rafting</p>
                <p>Currently, Clear Valley is ran by John Mallow's Granddaughter, Calie Fork. Calie is a lifelong rafter and has ran expeditions through Jackson Hole, the snake River, Flaming Gorge and other reputable areas. In addition, she has acquired her M.A. in Biology from Montana State University and a double B.A. in Biology and Business Management.</p>
                <p>Clear Valley White Water Rafting has been awarded <strong>Best in State</strong> for Tourist Adventures, among other prestigious awards. You will be in good hands and good views at Clear Valley!</p>
